All calculations were performed in autodE v. 1.4.4 (10.1002/anie.202011941). Calculations were performed using orca v. 5.0.3 (10.1002/wcms.81 10.1002/wcms.1327). Optimisation calculations performed at the PBE0(10.1063/1.478522 10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865)-D3BJ(10.1063/1.3382344 10.1002/jcc.21759)(RIJCOSX, 10.1016/j.chemphys.2008.10.036) level in combination with the def2-SVP (10.1039/B508541A) basis set.
 Low energy conformers located with the ETKDGv3 algorithm (10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00654) implemented in RDKit v. 2024.03.5 and optimised using orca then with orca. Single point calculations performed at the PBE0(10.1063/1.478522 10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865)-D3BJ(10.1063/1.3382344 10.1002/jcc.21759)(RIJCOSX, 10.1016/j.chemphys.2008.10.036) level in combination with the def2-TZVP (10.1039/B508541A) basis set.
